                           Program USBPROG_TEST
                             18 December 2021

usbprog_test [options]

Production test program for Embed Inc PIC programmers.  The full
production test procedure for Embed Inc PIC programmers are described in
separate documents for each programmer type.  These documentation files
are named <progname>_test, where <progname> is replaced by the name of the
specific programmer.  For example, the documentation file describing the
USBProg test procedure is named "usbprog_test".

This document only describes the USBPROG_TEST program.  In normal
production use the USBPROG_TEST program would not be run directly.
Separate menu entries exist for each programmer type to run the
USBPROG_TEST program with parameters suitable for that programmer.  The
menu entries are START > PROGRAMS > EMBED INC > PRODUCTION TESTS >
programmer-name.

The USBPROG_TEST command line options are:

  -PROG type

    Specifies the type of programmer to be tested.  The current options
    are USBPROG, USBPROG2, and LPROG.  The default is USBPROG2.  The
    keywords are case-insensitive.

  -PROTO version

    This option is used to specify that a particular prototype version is
    being tested, as apposed to a production version.  This option should
    only be used by engineering.  The default is version 0, which always
    indicates the production version.

    For example, this option is required for some engineering versions of
    the LProg programmer using board version 2 (LPRG2).  These were loaded
    with 18F2550 control processors instead of the 18F2455 processors that
    production units are loaded with.  The versions with 18F2550
    processors are designated prototype version 1.
